        <h1>What Your Support Does</h1>
        <p>Every 10 minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer. Her first reaction is fear and confusion. Support is just
            a phone call or mouse click away. Our free services offer a friendly ear and expert guidance to anyone dealing
            with this life-threatening illness. By running or walking with us, you can ensure that we are there when people
            need us. Here is how your contribution can help: $15 pays for a headscarf set, boosting the confidence of women
            who have lost their hair from her breast cancer treatment. $50 trains a member of our support network for a year
            to help improve the care of women with breast cancer. $125 covers the cost of counselling sessions to help women
            cope with the distress of their cancer treatment. $250 funds a hospital information station for a year so that
            people affected by breast cancer have easy access to the latest resources and help.</p>
